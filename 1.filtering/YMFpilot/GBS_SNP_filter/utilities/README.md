# split_vcf_by_pop.R
Given a popmap.txt file (see main folder) in the same directory as the vcf file you want to split into population-specific vcf files, this R-script will divvy up your original vcf file into population-specific vcf files with the suffix: "popname.pop.vcf". You'll need to know the number of header lines in your original vcf file (numberofheaders). You call the script (after pasting the whole thing into R and/or sourcing it) by:
```
split_vcf_by_pop(vcf_name,numberofheaders)
# e.g.
split_vcf_by_pop("hihi.biallelic.vcf",10)
```

# sMLH_MLH.R
Given a vcf file, this script will calculate MLH and sMLH for all individuals in your file. You call the script (after pasting the whole thing into R and/or sourcing it) by:
```
sMLH_MLH(vcf_name)
# e.g.
sMLH_MLH("hihi.biallelic.vcf")
```
The sMLH results will be suffixed by "sMLH.txt", and MLH results suffixed by "MLH.txt"

# pop_He
Given a vcf file and a popmap.txt file in the same directory, this script will calculate Ho, He (Hs in hierfstat), Fis, and bootstrap whether Fis is signficantly different from 0 for each population represented in the vcf. You call the script (after pasting the whole thing into R and/or sourcing it) by:
```
pop_He(vcf_name)
# e.g.
pop_He("hihi.biallelic.Bushy_Park.pop.vcf")
```
This script will take vcf files as input. If you want to do similar stuff with FSTAT files please see:

Also note the script here will analyse populations together - useful if you are comparing He and Ho. The code at https://github.com/laninsky/hierfstat_by_pop/tree/master will analyze them on a population-by-population basis.
